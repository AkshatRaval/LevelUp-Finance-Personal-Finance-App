-----

## üíª Tech Stack

  - **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios
  - **Database**: Firestore Database
  - **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
  - **Charting Library**: Recharts (for animated, interactive charts)
  - **Date Utility**: `date-fns`

-----

## üîê Authentication

Authentication is handled using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. When a user logs in, a token is generated and stored in a secure, `HttpOnly` cookie. This token is sent with subsequent requests to protected API endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their financial data.

Alternatively, this setup can be easily adapted to use **Firebase Authentication**.

-----

## üìä Charts Logic

The dashboard features two primary charts from **Recharts** to provide insightful financial summaries:

1.  **Bar Chart (Monthly Summary)**:

      - Displays total income vs. total expenses for each of the **last 6 months**.
      - Data is dynamically aggregated on the backend based on the user's transactions.
      - Uses `date-fns` to calculate the monthly ranges.

2.  **Pie Chart (Expense Distribution)**:

      - Shows a breakdown of expenses by category for the current month.
      - Helps users quickly identify where their money is going.

    default: Date.now
  }
}
```

### Transaction Schema (`Transaction.js`)

```javascript
{
  userId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User', // Foreign key relationship to the User model
    required: true
  },
  type: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['income', 'expense'],
    required: true
  },
